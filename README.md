# VisClean V0.1  
VisClean is a web-based system that progressively turns wrong visualizations into correct ones by interactive data cleaning. 
It supports: (1) Wrong Visualization Detection: Given a dataset and a visualization, VisClean can automatically identify wrong visualizations caused by dirty data. 
(2) Active Interaction: VisClean provides a novel sliding-window-based method for users to directly manipulate the visualization (e.g., merging two bars) for cleaning the data. 
(3) Passive Interaction: VisClean also selects the most beneficial and visualization-aware cleaning questions to ask the user.
